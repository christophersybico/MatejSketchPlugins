Sketch Plugins by Matej
=============

A box for random useful sketch plugins

- **Toggle Specs** (cmd+L) toggles visibility of all of the layer groups and layers in your document named "specs", including "specs_something". Other than specs this could be useful with hidden guides.

- **Select Parent Artboards** (cmd+shift+A) selects artboards that contain currently selected layers or groups. You can just draw a selection rectangle and hit the shortcut instead of selecting artboards one by one. Useful for moving many artboards around at once.

- **Align to Pixel** (cmd+shift+â€™) aligns the selected layer or group to whole pixels by rounding the x and y values.
